    "### Source and Format\n",
    "We are using the **Crime Data from 2020 to Present** \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Source:** https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present \n",
    "- **Format:** CSV  \n",
    "- **File Used:** `Crime_Data_from_2020_to_Present.csv`  \n",
    "- **Description:** Each row represents one reported crime incident, including date, location, victim demographics, offense classification codes, and investigation status.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Attributes\n",
    "The dataset contains the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DR_NO** – Division of Records number (unique incident identifier)  \n",
    "- **Date Rptd** – Date the crime was reported  \n",
    "- **DATE OCC** – Date and time the crime occurred  \n",
    "- **TIME OCC** – Time of occurrence (in HHMM format)  \n",
    "- **AREA** – LAPD basic command area code  \n",
    "- **AREA NAME** – Name of the LAPD area  \n",
    "- **Rpt Dist No** – Reporting district number  \n",
    "- **Part 1-2** – Whether the crime is Part 1 or Part 2 (FBI classification)  \n",
    "- **Crm Cd** – Numeric crime code  \n",
    "- **Crm Cd Desc** – Description of the crime (textual category)  \n",
    "- **Mocodes** – Modus operandi codes  \n",
    "- **Vict Age** – Age of the victim  \n",
    "- **Vict Sex** – Victim sex  \n",
    "- **Vict Descent** – Victim race/ethnicity  \n",
    "- **Premis Cd** – Coded type of property/premises  \n",
    "- **Premis Desc** – Description of type of property/premises  \n",
    "- **Weapon Used Cd** – Numeric weapon code  \n",
    "- **Weapon Desc** – Description of weapon used  \n",
    "- **Status** – Case status code  \n",
    "- **Status Desc** – Case status description  \n",
    "- **Crm Cd 1–4** – Additional crime codes if multiple offenses occurred  \n",
    "- **LOCATION** – Street-level address information  \n",
    "- **Cross Street** – Cross-street detail (may be missing)  \n",
    "- **LAT** – Latitude coordinate  \n",
    "- **LON** – Longitude coordinate  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Class Attribute (Prediction Target)\n",
    "The target variable for our classification task will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Crm Cd Desc` — the textual description of the crime type.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **multi-class classification** problem with dozens of possible labels (*THEFT OF IDENTITY*, *BATTERY – SIMPLE ASSAULT*, *BURGLARY*, etc.).\n"

    "## Implementation / Technical Merit\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project will be implemented in Python using the tools and techniques covered in CPSC 322. The goal is to build a complete end-to-end classification pipeline operating on a large, real-world dataset. The implementation will include the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**\n",
    "Because crime data contains inconsistencies and missing values, we expect to perform several preprocessing steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handling missing values in:  \n",
    "  - `Vict Sex`, `Vict Descent`, `Vict Age`  \n",
    "  - `Weapon Desc`, `Weapon Used Cd`  \n",
    "  - `Cross Street` and some location fields  \n",
    "- Converting `DATE OCC` and `TIME OCC` into usable features  \n",
    "- Normalizing or scaling numerical attributes (`TIME OCC`, `Vict Age`)  \n",
    "- Removing or encoding high-cardinality text fields such as `Mocodes`  \n",
    "- Dropping purely administrative fields such as `DR_NO` if they do not aid classification  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Feature Engineering**\n",
    "To create meaningful features for classification, we will engineer new attributes such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Temporal features**  \n",
    "  - Day of week  \n",
    "  - Month  \n",
    "  - Hour of day (derived from `TIME OCC`)  \n",
    "  - Weekend vs. weekday  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Location-based features**  \n",
    "  - Using `AREA` or `AREA NAME` as categorical features  \n",
    "  - Including latitude/longitude (possibly binned into zones)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Victim-related features**  \n",
    "  - Age groups (e.g., 0–17, 18–30, 31–45, 46–65, 65+)  \n",
    "  - Encoding sex and descent categories  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Classifiers to be Implemented**\n",
    "We will evaluate **three different classifiers**, consistent with course requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Decision Tree Classifier**  \n",
    "2. **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**  \n",
    "3. **Naive Bayes**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Additional classifiers (like Random Forest) may be explored if time allows, but our minimum deliverable is three.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Feature Selection**\n",
    "Because several attributes—such as `Premis Desc`, `Crm Cd Desc` (labels), and `Weapon Desc`—are high-cardinality categorical features, one-hot encoding may increase dimensionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "To manage this, we may explore:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mutual Information scoring  \n",
    "- Decision-tree feature importance  \n",
    "- Filtering out low-frequency categories  \n",
    "- Dimensionality reduction (PCA) if numeric feature space grows too large  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Evaluation**\n",
    "We will evaluate classifier performance using:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accuracy  \n",
    "- Confusion matrices  \n",
    "- Precision and recall (macro-averaged due to class imbalance)  \n",
    "- Stratified train/test/validation splits  \n",
    "\n",
    "These assessments will help determine which model performs best on multi-class crime prediction using real-world, imbalanced data.\n"
