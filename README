##  Data Setup

This project uses the LAPD Crime Dataset (2020–Present).  
Download from: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present

This dataset is too big to push to github, so it must be locally installed following these steps:

1. In order to run the code, create a folder named "data" in root dir
2. Place the downloaded CSV file into the /data folder
